What is Sona framework?
=======================

Easy to use web layout framework based on LessCSS.

You can use it for:
 * fast prototyping (use grids, collection of styles ... );
 * in place handcrafted web design (change code, it immdiatly redraws in browser);
 * as library full of heplfull mixins (army knife for css);
 * large layout projects with lot of code organized in modules with minimal code
   duplication;


If you are Designer with intention to handcraft your webpages you'll be exited:
 * Highly customizible grid modules. Just define your vertical rhythm and grid
   size, number of columns, gap size. And you'll have a set of mixins for
   defining any block geometry to fit your grid. 
 * Setting base font size and max font size will create defaults for font
   settings to fit vertical rhythm and form beautiful geometrical progression
   for headings.
 * Auto update feature will help you in ``Inventing on Principle``. You don't
   need to reload web page to see changes you've made in CSS. (Currently you
   still need to reload a page after changes in html, but we are working on
   fixing it. Also Sona Framework differs a lot from classical layout
   frameworks to be more sematic, so usualy you dont need to change html to
   change graphical presentation)
 * Library greatly crafted ready to use building block like buttons, shadings etc.
